# Online Resume
This is a simple web-based resume created during the Udemy course "[The Complete Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/)", completed as a self-study exercise during my internship period (unrelated to company work). The project uses only HTML to present my IT-related professional background and skills.

*Note: The resume content reflects my experience and qualifications at the time of creation. This project is for learning purposes only and will not be regularly updated.*

*The project was developed independently by me, the course merely provided a direction as to what the project should achieve.*
