# Online Resume
This is a simple web-based resume created during the Udemy course "[The Complete Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/)" as part of my internship at Terrera AG. The project uses only HTML to present my IT-related professional background and skills.

*Note: This project represents my resume, experience, and projects at the time of creation. This project is for learning purposes only and will not be regularly updated.*

The project was developed independently by me, following general guidelines provided by the course. It was intended to help me practice HTML.
